## Sorting Records by Column Headers (e.g., Date, Member)

*Sorting service records by column headers allows you to organize your data in ascending or descending order based on specific fields such as **Date** or **Member**. This helps in quickly locating records and analyzing data patterns.*

### How to Sort Records:

1. Navigate to the **Service Records** section within your group (e.g., **Day Habilitation**).
2. Locate the table displaying the service records.
3. At the top of each column, you'll see the column headers such as **Date**, **Member**, **Assigned Staff**, and others.
4. ✅ **Click on a column header** (e.g., **Date** or **Member**) to sort the records based on that column.
   - The first click will sort the records in ascending order.
   - Click again to sort the records in descending order.
5. **Observe the sorting indicator:**
   - An arrow icon next to the column header shows the sort order (upward for ascending, downward for descending).

### Tips:

- *Tip: Sorting by **Member** helps you to group all records for a specific participant together.*
- *Note: If multiple records have the same value in the sorted column, the system may apply a secondary sort automatically.*

*Now that you know how to sort records by column headers, let's explore how to further narrow down records using filters.*

## Using Filters to Narrow Down Records

*Filters allow you to refine your service records view by displaying only the records that meet certain criteria, such as a specific **Date Range**, **Member**, or **Assigned Staff**.*

### How to Use Filters:

1. In the **Service Records** section, find the filter buttons above the records table.
2. ✅ **Click on the** **Date** **filter button** to select a specific date or date range:
   - A calendar picker will appear.
   - Choose the start and end dates to set your desired range.
3. ✅ **Click on the** **Member** **filter button** to filter by participant:
   - A dropdown list of members will appear.
   - Select one or multiple members to display only their records.
4. ✅ **Click on the** **Assigned Staff** **filter button** to filter by staff member:
   - Choose the staff member assigned to the records you wish to view.
5. **Apply the filters:**
   - The table will automatically update to show records matching your selected criteria.

### Tips:

- *Tip: Combine multiple filters (e.g., **Date** and **Member**) to pinpoint specific records.*
- *Best Practice: Clear your filters after reviewing to ensure you're viewing all records.*

*With filters, you can narrow down records effectively. Next, let's see how searching can help you find specific participants or dates.*

## Customizing the Display of Service Records

   - Changes may be saved automatically or require clicking a **"Save"** button.

### Tips:
