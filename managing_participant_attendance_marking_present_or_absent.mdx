## Editing Attendance Records

Mistakes happen, or sometimes attendance status changes. You can easily edit attendance records to correct any errors.

‚úÖ **Editing Attendance** allows you to update a participant's status at any time.

**To edit attendance records:**

1. Go to the **Service Records** table in your group's page.
2. Find the participant whose attendance you need to change.
3. Under the **Attendance** column, click on the opposite status button to update it.
   - If they were marked **Present**, click on ‚úÖ **Absent** to change their status to absent.
   - If they were marked **Absent**, click on ‚úÖ **Present** to mark them as present.

*Example*:
- If **Athena Hall** was marked as present but is actually absent:
  1. Locate her name in the **Service Records** table.
  2. Click on the ‚úÖ **Absent** button to update her status.

*Best Practice*: Regularly review the attendance statuses to ensure all records are current and accurate.
