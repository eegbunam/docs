- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
  - In the **Advanced Sync Settings**, choose how to handle data conflicts:
    - **Prefer Kibu data** over external changes.
    - **Prefer external data** to overwrite Kibu entries.
    - **Prompt for manual review** when conflicts occur.

- **Monitor Sync Logs**:
  - Navigate to **Settings > Sync Logs** to review synchronization activities.
  - Filter logs by date, integration, or error type for in-depth analysis.

- **Data Validation Rules**:

   - Click on an entry to view detailed error messages and stack traces.

4. **Check API Rate Limits and Quotas**:
   - Some external systems impose limitations on API calls.
   - Verify that your usage has not exceeded these limits.
